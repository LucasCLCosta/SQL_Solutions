user_firstname: text
user_lastname: text
video_id: text

selecao as (
    SELECT 
        video_id
        ,concat(user_firstname, user_lastname) as unique_user
        ,flag_id
    FROM user_flags
    WHERE flag_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY video_id, unique_user,3
--select * from user_flags;
) 
SELECT
    video_id
    ,count(distinct unique_user) as num_unique_users
FROM selecao
GROUP BY video_id
